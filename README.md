âš  THIS THEME IS IN BETA! it should work and i won't commit any completly broken code, but some stuff may look funky/unstyled. you have been warned.

# Pointless
A rectangular -but not pointy- customizable Powercord theme, with multiple skins (supporting dark and light mode), an option for backround images, and message bubbles + your messages are right-aligned.  
## Configuration
To customize the theme (change palettes, add a background image, enable/disable features, etc.), open the `settings.scss` file and follow the instructions enclosed.  
If you edit the settings at all, you should also open the `.gitignore` file and edit as instructed. A notice will appear to let you know if there are new settings and you need to manually update your settings file.

# Installation - Powercord
