# Pointless
![clones](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatthegit.penguinspy.repl.co%2Fsheilds%2Fpointless) [![Powercord](https://img.shields.io/badge/client-Powercord-7289D9?logo=discord&logoColor=fff)](https://powercord.dev/)  
A rectangular -but not pointy- customizable Powercord theme, with multiple skins (supporting dark and light mode), an option for backround images, and message bubbles + your messages are right-aligned.  

## Configuration
To customize the theme (change palettes, add a background image, enable/disable features, etc.), open the `settings.scss` file and follow the instructions enclosed.  
If you edit the settings at all, you should also open the `.gitignore` file and edit as instructed. A notice will appear to let you know if there are new settings and you need to manually update your settings file.

# Installation - Powercord
Open command prompt and run:
```cd powercord/src/Powercord/themes && git clone https://github.com/Penguin-Spy/pointless```

Other client mods are not supported at this time, this may or may not change. Do not make a Github issue requesting support for a different client mod :)
